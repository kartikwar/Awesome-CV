      \item{Background Removal : This service removes background from any image uploaded by customer and leaves only the salient content in the
image. Wrote code from scratch for training the pipeline of the state-of-the-art fba-matting algorithm and also trained U-Net model for saliency
detection. The visual acceptance rate for entire pipeline is 87 percent. Technologies Used: python, pytorch, opencv }

      \item{Mask Detection : This service helps to identify people not wearing masks and sends alerts in real time. This service was designed keeping the Covid19 pandemic in mind. Trained a SSD mobilenet v2 object-detection model and achieved a precision greater than 85 percent. Technologies Used: python, tensorflow , opencv  }
      \item{Connector Detection : This service was responsible for detecting joints(connectors) in factories. Based on these joints the workers decided when to drill the oil pipe.  Trained a YOLO v3 object-detection model and achieved a precision greater than 88 percent. Technologies Used: python, tensorflow , opencv }

        \item{Table Detection : This service is used to detect tables (bordered and borderless) or table like structures in a pdf document. Built and trained a deep learning model for detecting tables. This was built using Faster Rcnn(research paper) and curriculum learning. Pretrained VGG16 net was fine tuned on our documents to achieve a precision of 84 percent.  Technologies Used: python, tensorflow, opencv}        
        \item{Template Detection : This service assigns templates to various documents, two documents belong to the same template if they have similar type of text or structure. Built and trained a siamese network with pretrained VGG16 net to detect whether two images are similar or not. If the first page of two different documents were detected to be similar by the siamese network, they were mapped to the same template in the database. Technologies Used: python, tensorflow, opencv, MongoDb}

        \item {Developed Wildfire Acquisition Service. It finds potential customers for buying our product who are then targeted to generate revenue. Achieved a high conversion rate of 20 per cent. Used Machine Learning(Logistic Regression) and Pearson Correlation to train the classifier on previous data. Technologies Used: Python, Scikit Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, MongoDB, MySql  }
        \item {Developed Update Categorization Service. It fetches all the product updates made by the customers on their websites and then categorizes them into offers, discounts, price. Applied a bag of keywords model to classify the updates into categories. Technologies Used: Python, Scikit Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, MongoDB  }
